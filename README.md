# Library Application
In this repository I created a small CRUD Spring web-application.
<br />

Application features:
- add, modify and remove persons from the database and user list;
- add, modify and remove books from the database and book list;
- control of person taken books, attach and detach books from people;
- correct input data validation from the user;

It will help you if you have a small library and give books to your friendsðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

Technology stack used during development: âœ…Java âœ…Spring (MVC, Core)
âœ…JdbcTemplateâœ…PostgreSQL âœ…Hibernate-validatorâœ…Thymeleaf âœ…HTML/CSS  âœ…Maven
